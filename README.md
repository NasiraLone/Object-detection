# Road Condition Detection Using YOLOv5
# Overview
This project uses YOLOv5, a high-performance object detection model, to identify various road conditions such as turns, straight paths, and obstacles in images of roads. The goal is to train a model capable of detecting these conditions, which can be useful for applications in road safety and navigation.

A labeled dataset of road images stored in Google Drive
YOLOv5 repository (cloned from GitHub)
# Setup Instructions
# 1. Mount Google Drive
Mount Google Drive in Google Colab to access your dataset and save outputs, such as trained model weights and detection images. This setup enables convenient reading and writing of files from Google Drive.

# 2. Clone the YOLOv5 Repository
To get the YOLOv5 code and all required scripts, clone the YOLOv5 repository from GitHub. This repository includes everything needed to train and test YOLOv5, including pretrained models, data configurations, and scripts for training and detection.

# 3. Install Dependencies
YOLOv5 requires several Python libraries to run. The repository includes a list of these in a requirements file. Installing these dependencies ensures that the YOLOv5 scripts run smoothly without compatibility issues.

# 4. Prepare the Dataset
Prepare your labeled dataset, stored in Google Drive. You will need a data configuration file (in YAML format) that defines:

Paths to your training and validation image folders.
The classes in your dataset (for example, left turn, right turn, straight, obstacle). This configuration allows YOLOv5 to understand your dataset structure and classify objects based on the specified categories.
# 5. Train the Model
Run the training script to begin training YOLOv5 on your custom dataset. Set parameters such as:

Image size: Defines the resolution of the training images (for example, 416x416 pixels).
Batch size: Specifies how many images are processed together in each training step.
Epochs: Number of complete passes over the dataset during training.
Data configuration: The path to the YAML file that defines your dataset.
Weights: Start training with a pretrained model (e.g., YOLOv5 small model) to speed up learning and potentially improve performance.
During training, YOLOv5 will display metrics such as accuracy and loss to help you monitor the model's progress.

# 6. Run Detection on Test Images
After training, you can use YOLOv5 to perform object detection on new road images. Specify the trained model weights and the folder containing your test images, and YOLOv5 will output the detected road conditions in these images. Detection results will be saved for easy review.

# Results
Training metrics and sample images with detections are stored in specific folders within YOLOv5's output directory. You can view these images to evaluate the modelâ€™s performance, assess detection accuracy, and make any necessary adjustments.
